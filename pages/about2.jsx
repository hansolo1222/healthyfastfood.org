{`A few years ago I was working a stressful job in downtown Boston and my diet was horrendous. When lunch time came I‚Äôd grab the quickest thing which was some sort of fast food.

I knew something had to change.

I started keeping a list of healthiest options at the places I normally went to on Google Sheets. I included the nutrition information, because I was trying to eat meals with higher protein and lower carbs. These were meals that made me feel energized and full. My coworkers called it ‚ÄúThe List‚Äù. After adhering to this list almost religiously for a few months, I realized I was feeling much more energized, and shedding pounds every week 

At one point I thought, instead of writing meals down by hand, I wanted an automatic way of knowing what the healthiest options at every restaurant was. And HealthyFastFood.org was born! Today, HealthyFastFood has nutrition information for over 300 restaurants (rapidly growing) and 10,000 meals.
